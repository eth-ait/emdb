## Dataset
To receive access to the data, please fill out the [application form](https://emdb.ait.ethz.ch). You will receive an e-mail with more information after your application has been approved.

For an overview of how EMDB is structured, please refer to the [dataset overview](dataset.md).

## Visualization
We use [aitviewer](https://github.com/eth-ait/aitviewer) to visualize the data. The code was tested with Python 3.8 on Windows 10.

### Installation
```bash
conda create -n emdb python=3.8
pip install aitviewer tabulate
```
This does not automatically install a GPU-version of PyTorch. If your environment already contains it, you should be good to go, otherwise you may wish to install it manually, e.g. on Windows

```python
pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu117
```

Please also download the SMPL model by following the instructions on the [SMPL-X GitHub page](https://github.com/vchoutas/smplx#downloading-the-model).

### Setup
1. Change the `SMPLX_MODELS` variable in `configuration.py` to where you downloaded the SMPL model. This folder should contain a subfolder `smpl` with the respective model files.
2. Change the `EMDB_ROOT` variable in `configuration.py` to where you extracted the EMDB dataset. This folder should contain subfolders `P0`, `P1`, etc. 

### Visualize EMDB Data
Run the following command to visualize a sequence. `SUBJECT_ID` refers to the ID Of the participant, i.e. `P0-P9` and `SEQUENCE_ID` is the 2-digit identifier that is prepended to each sequence's name:

```python
python visualize.py --subject {SUBJECT_ID} --sequence {SEQUENCE_ID}
```

By default, this opens the viewer in the 3D view. You can choose to show the reprojected poses instead by specifying `--view_from_camera`. If you specify `--draw_2d` the 2D keypoints and bounding boxes will be drawn on top of the image. If you pass `--draw_trajectories` the SMPL root and camera trajectories will be drawn in addition.

### Visualize GLAMR
We provide a script to visualize [GLAMR](https://github.com/NVlabs/GLAMR) results. An example result that reproduces Figure 9 of the main paper is provided in `assets/GLAMR`. To visualize it, run the following command:

```python
python visualize_GLAMR.py
```

## Evaluation

### Example using HybrIK
We provide code to load and evaluate HybrIK results on the EMDB test set, which in the paper is referred to as `EMDB 1`. Based on this evaluation code, it should be straight-forward to extend the evaluation to other methods (see below).

To run the evaluation, use the following command:
```python
python evaluate.py {RESULT_ROOT}
```

The `RESULT_ROOT` is a folder that is expected to have the same general folder structure as EMDB, i.e.:
```
RESULT_ROOT
├── PX
    ├── sequence1
        ├── hybrIK-out
            ├── 000000.pkl
            ├── 000001.pkl
            ├── ...
    ├── sequence2
    ├── ...
    ├── sequenceN
```

I.e., `EMDB_ROOT` can function as a `RESULT_ROOT`, if the corresponding results are stored in a subfolder `hybrIK-out` for each sequence. The evaluation code computes the MPJPE, MPJAE, MVE, and jitter metrics as reported in the paper. It reports both the pelvis-aligned and Procrustes-aligned versions (*-PA), as well as standard deviations. Further, it prints the metrics for each sequence individually, as well as the average over all sequences.

### How to evaluate your own method
In order to run the evaluations with your own results, follow these steps:
1. In [`evaluation_loaders.py`](evaluation_loaders.py) define a function to load your result. Follow the signature and return values of the existing `load_hybrik` function.
2. In [`evaluation_engine.py`](evaluation_engine.py) register your method by giving it a name in a global variable, e.g. `MYMETHOD = 'My Method'`. Then using that name as a key, extend the following two `dict`s (follow the existing example with HybrIK for reference):
    - `METHOD_TO_RESULT_FOLDER`: This maps to the subfolder in `{RESULT_ROOT}/{SUBJECT_ID}/{SEQUENCE_ID}` where your methods result will be stored.
    - `METHOD_TO_LOAD_FUNCTION`: This maps to the loading function you defined in step 1.
3. In the function [`EvaluationEngine.get_gender_for_baseline`](evaluation_engine.py) select the appropriate SMPL gender for your method.
4. Finally, in [`evaluate.py`](evaluate.py) import `MYMETHOD` and add it to the list of methods that the evaluation engine should evaluate.
